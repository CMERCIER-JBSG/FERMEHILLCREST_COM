Peonies Grown with Care in the Heart of Knowlton's Eastern Townships

Perched in the peaceful rolling hills of Knowlton, in the Lac-Brome region, our peony farm is a true haven of beauty and serenity. At the end of spring and the beginning of summer, the fields light up with majestic blooms in soft and vibrant hues, lovingly cultivated with care, passion, and deep respect for nature.

## 2. Our Story

### Title
Our Story

### Section: What We Do (from existing site)
It all began with the peony root — a precious ingredient we use in our skincare. From there came the desire to go further — to cultivate it ourselves, to better understand its strength, its beauty, and its deep connection to the earth.

Today, we grow peonies in our fields with the same care and respect we pour into every product. It's our way of honoring the plant, its symbolism, and what it teaches us: to take our time, to root deeply, and to bloom fully.

### Section: Peony Roots
*Peony roots: Buried deep in the soil, the peony root holds the promise of beauty and resilience.*

### Design Notes
- Lifestyle photography
- Warm editorial layout
- Connection to JB SkinSavvi (peony root in skincare)
